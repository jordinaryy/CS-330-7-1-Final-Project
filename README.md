#How do I approach designing software?


I usually start with an overall idea of what I want to build, and then I break it into smaller pieces that are easier to handle. For this project, I thought about the desk scene and then worked on each object one at a time, like the monitor, books, screen, pencils, and mug (theres more but you get the gist).

#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?


This project helped me practice designing in a 3D space. I learned how to apply textures and lighting in a way that made the objects look more realistic, instead of just flat shapes.

#What design process did you follow for your project work?


My process was to start with simple shapes first, then add more detail in each step. After that, I tested how the scene looked, fixed any issues, and only then moved forward.

#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?


Working step by step and testing along the way will help me in future projects. It keeps the program running smoothly and makes it easier to catch mistakes before they become bigger problems.

#How do I approach developing programs?


I start small with the basics so I know the program works, and then I slowly add more features. This way I don’t get stuck with a lot of errors at once.

#What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?


I tried to organize my code better by keeping it modular, and I also learned how to use shaders to handle lighting and textures, which made the scene look more realistic.

#How did iteration factor into your development?


Iteration was a big part of the project. Each milestone improved my scene, starting from simple objects to adding textures and then finishing with lighting effects.

##How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?


At first, I just focused on getting objects to show up. Over time, I started adding comments, organizing my code more clearly, and thinking about how each part worked together.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?


Computer science gives me the skills I need to solve problems and build programs. It helps me move closer to my career goal of working in software or game development.

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?


I learned more about 3D coordinates, textures, and lighting, which will help me in other programming or graphics classes later on.

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?


These skills can transfer to professional work like building video games, simulations, or other visual software where such environments are important.
